      Online market nowadays is typical, but few are those catering for Hyped
      products such as Sneakers, Designer clothing and accessories. The
      ‚ÄúHypedSneakers‚Äù team have built is an eCommerce online store which would
      be an online shopping for footwear and clothing for Hyped products from
      different brands. The interactive e-commerce platform would let users
      create an online profile so they could purchase on the website their
      favorite Sneaker brands, Hyped. ‚ÄúHypedSneakers‚Äù would be a collection of
      clothing that would also include T-shirts, hoodies and sweatshirts,
      accessories like backpacks, fanny packs, and all the trendy stuff
      exclusively on retail amounts.

        üîç What was main benefit of the application?
      </Typography>
      <hr />
      <br />
      This application for online shopping has many benefits for the users. One
      of the benefits of this application for the users is that they could shop
      confidently especially for the introverts. Have you seen those salespeople
      waiting in the stores and once you step inside, they will come to you
      immediately? Sometimes they are a big help but most of the time it could
      be uncomfortable when someone‚Äôs keep on following you around the stores,
      then you‚Äôll end up buying something, although you don‚Äôt want that product,
      because you feel shy to turn down their hospitality. This online shop
      application will give the user the confidence to select and buy whatever
      item they want and get what they pay for.
      <br />
      <br />
      This application will also benefit those people who are too busy to even
      go shop in store. The application could be accessed anytime 24/7, thus,
      this is the most convenient and fastest way to shop. It will be fastest
      because the customer will see right away if the item is in stock unlike in
      the physical store that it will take minutes sometimes half an hour to
      know if the item is available because the salesperson will need to go and
      look in the stockroom for the product availability. The waiting time has a
      great impact on customer service. Negative brand/store perception may
      result from poor customer service.
