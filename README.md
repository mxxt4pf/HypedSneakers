# E-Commerce Web Application: HypedSneakers
Group based class project towards a real-life working e-commerce web application letting clients purchase the "Hyped" products they're looking 
for in the market by creating their own account with credentials, adding/removing orders from the shopping cart, 
making payments using their preferred mode of payment, and much more. 

Starting the react Application :
-> go to terminal 
Step 1 : ls for showing contents(files) in the directory
Step 2: As react uses node, we do cd clientapp in our case
Step 3: Start node package manager using npm start (this would start the local host for our clientapp)

Starting API Server :
-> go to terminal
Step 1: cd API 
Step 2: Might wanna use "dotnet clear" or just clear to clear the terminal garbage and then,
        hit dotnet run to start the Swagger UI.
